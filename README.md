to start the program you will have to start the debug in vs code you will then have to go into the debug console and copy the urls from there
it should look like this the number may diffrent http://localhost:5028 

you will then need to add
/Arrays/even

so your url should look like this 

http://localhost:5028/Arrays/even

this will give you a few even numbers that i randomly chose and you won't be able to see them but the odd numbers that i put are turned into the zeros you see

if you instead add
/evenList
your url will look like this 
http://localhost:5028/Arrays/evenList

and you will only recieave even numbers and no zero's
